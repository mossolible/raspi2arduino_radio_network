2.4GHz Radio Network for Raspberry PI and Arduino

<h2>What you need to install on Raspberry PI before going on.</h2>
1. RPi.GPIO from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO
2. Py-spidev from https://github.com/doceme/py-spidev
I've modified original nrf24.py from https://github.com/jpbarraca/pynrf24/blob/master/nrf24.py to be suitable for Raspberry PI and RPi.GPIO.
